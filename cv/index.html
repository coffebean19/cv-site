                        Worked at this company where they payed for shit. The IT guy charge was nice enough.
                        Being payed R12/h was the payed for shit part. 
                        Can't trust family. Helped design and implement a system wherein 
                        construction machine mechanics can pull up pdf's of the manuals of the machines in
                        the field to fix it. We used the internet to deliver it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tech we used was your average html, css and javascript frontend, spiced with
                        some Razor pages processing. The backend was a C# 8.0 web-forms. It was an atrocity 
                        to work with. We made it work. The PDF files themselves was in GBs of magnitude, so 
                        kinda large. There I learned to feed it through using a blob of bytes and resuming where
                        the upload failed (being in South Africa and being Vodacom's bitch, this happens quite a lot).
                        Also did the typical IT support things like fixing laptops, telling the secretary that no, you
                        can't print a red line with only black ink, I can't reprogram ink. Also telling the upper echolons
                        of uncles that their daughters (my cousings) computers are shit and that's why they can't do 
                        andy of the CAD things. Just in a lot more acceptable way of course.
