            <p>Adding some good filler to add to the site just to test some things.</p>
            <div>This is a div added with a header of <h2 class="header">Header two</h2> and is to just test the way the card expands.</div>
            <div>The third div will explain that the fourth div will have a story in it written followed by link leading to basically nowhere</div>
            <div>So this fourth div has a story, a story that will be told. It is going to be told. It is a good story.
                The story starts now. I will tell you this story right now. Once upon a time we had a goose. A typical goose,
                miserable as can be. We all know that geese loves being miserable and giving people reasons to be miserable. You
                may disagree, but then you have never met a goose. I have, and it was a miserable experience each and everytime.
                Now this miserable goose was being miserable, but there was a tortoise that was as cheery as can be. The tortoise had
                nowhere to be, and was always at home. He was good tortoise. You will meet tortoises and realise what I say is true. They are quite
                at home with themselves and quite content. This is a story about a miserable goose and a happy tortoise.

                <p>As we read in the prologue and as the title implies, we have a tortoise and a goose.</p>

                        Worked at this company where they payed for shit. The IT guy charge was nice enough.
                        Being payed R12/h was the payed for shit part. 
                        Can't trust family. Helped design and implement a system wherein 
                        construction machine mechanics can pull up pdf's of the manuals of the machines in
                        the field to fix it. We used the internet to deliver it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tech we used was your average html, css and javascript frontend, spiced with
                        some Razor pages processing. The backend was a C# 8.0 web-forms. It was an atrocity 
                        to work with. We made it work. The PDF files themselves was in GBs of magnitude, so 
                        kinda large. There I learned to feed it through using a blob of bytes and resuming where
                        the upload failed (being in South Africa and being Vodacom's bitch, this happens quite a lot).
                        Also did the typical IT support things like fixing laptops, telling the secretary that no, you
                        can't print a red line with only black ink, I can't reprogram ink. Also telling the upper echolons
                        of uncles that their daughters (my cousings) computers are shit and that's why they can't do 
                        andy of the CAD things. Just in a lot more acceptable way of course.
