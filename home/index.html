            <p>My name Istvan Mayer. I am a student at the university of the North West university, Potchefstroom. I am finishing my degree in Bsc. IT
                ending 2021, and starting with my Honnours in Computer Science and Information Technology starting next year, 2022.
            </p>
            <p>I am from a small town in the Northren Cape called Upington. I was born there and only left when I finished matric in 2017. 
                Since then I have started my academic career at the NWU. Going with the IT stereotype of coffee I went along and trained to be 
                a barista, so now I can make speciality coffee and really love it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, yes I love computers and software, all things computer science. Front-end is not really my 
                main focus of design, with having a greater love for the more back-end things such as operating systems,
                servers, CLI applications and the design architecture that powers everything in the behind. In time I will
                do some UI/UX courses and improve this site. I have my eyes on React and Ionic, and in time I will rebuilt this
                site to be a bit more softer on the eye.
            </p>
