    <section class="rounded border-2 border-stone-700 p-2 bg-amber-50 shadow-lg hover:shadow mt-6">
      <h2 class="text-stone-600">Changes planned</h2>
      <p class="text-stone-900">Color scheme is still in planning phase. Basically everything will change at some point
        because this looks nice enough but not yet a sense of great niceness that needs to be achieved.</p>
      <p class="text-stone-800">Also the entire card effect with shadows and what not will not be the main look as I have
        other things planned but thought it looked nice. Planning in making the CV page be PDF friendly but also give a
        nice Paper effect, so hopefully that's easier said than done (Isn't that everything in development?)</p>
      <p class="text-stone-900">Anyways that's most I got at this stage. Thanks for stopping whoever you might be random
        stranger.</p>
