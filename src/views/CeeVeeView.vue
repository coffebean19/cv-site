      <p class="text-stone-800">Color scheme is still in planning phase. Basically everything will change at some point
        because this looks nice enough but not yet a sense of great niceness that needs to be achieved.</p>
      <p class="text-stone-700">Also the entire card effect with shadows and what not will not be the main look as I have
        other things planned but thought it looked nice. Planning in making the CV page be PDF friendly but also give a
        nice Paper effect, so hopefully that's easier said than done (Isn't that everything in development?)</p>
      <p class="text-stone-800">Anyways that's most I got at this stage. Thanks for stopping by whoever you might be
        random stranger.</p>
