      <p class="px-6 text-stone-800">It was a lazy autumn day, with colors of yellow, orange, and purple being mixed with the breeze. It was a fine day as any to have a proper cup of coffee, even if it was already late in the afternoon.</p>
      <p class="px-6 text-stone-800">Yet something was amiss. Something was not quite right. A peculiar feeling was creeping around. I wish I could describe it, but it is not in the air. It is not the weather. Nor in the coffee.</p>
      <p class="px-6 text-stone-800">Then what exacty? It was colorful, and it is as if someone, or something, wished to disturb the serenity of the scene.</p>
