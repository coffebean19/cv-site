    <EssayCard header="A feeling of.." text="Life is a tragic comedy, but who's the joke? The fool, the play, or the people laughing?
                                              Am I the punchline or is it the end result of all my efforts?
                                              Do we laugh because it's funny or do we laugh because we're too afraid to cry?"

    <EssayCard header="We're not hard people" text="We're not hard people. Maybe a bit misunderstood. It may be that some find a certain sadness among us, or a sense that a shadow follows us constantly. They wouldn't be wrong. 
A light truly shines when it is in absolute darkness. It's probably how we knew about one another deeply. We saw one another in an imperceptible darkness, one in which our souls mingled. It was not by choice nor was it by coincidence. It may have been bad luck, or it may have been meant to be that way. Nonetheless we both were there, no matter the reason. 
This may have also been the reason we saw one another, as the light truly shines through a willingness to understand. Through knowing what it meant to be alone. Being left behind. Being the only one to keep standing when everyone else fell.
It may be that you don’t see the light in our eyes, but that’s because we’ve learned to let people see your soul is to let people abuse you. This may also be why we found one another. We could let one another see into our own souls and know that we are safe in one another’s gaze. It wasn’t a gaze to gain, but a gaze to give. We looked at one another in order to give ourselves to one another.

<EssayCard header="Imbalances" text="In an effort to curb the growth of the tumor, they killed off the body instead of cutting out the tumor. Cutting it out will leave a hole that is unfulfilled, but it gives a place for healthy growth to happen. Yet we killed the body because getting the tumor out was too terrifying for us. 
The unbalanced scales weren't balanced out, but rather tipped unbalanced to the other side. 
Instead of waiting for the harvest and separating the chaff from the wheat, the entire field was burned to the ground leaving behind ash and dust.
If the eye fights the ear because it is not an eye, and the ear fights the eye because it is not an ear, we shall all be blind and deaf at the end of it. 

As Sir William Francis Butler said, ‘The nation that will insist on drawing a broad line of demarcation between the fighting man and the thinking man is liable to find its fighting done by fools and its thinking done by cowards.’

In this instance, the thinking coward and the fighting fool became enemies. This is the crux of the imbalance. The coward only sees the foolishness, and the fool only sees the cowardliness.

Yet, here we are. The fool knows not how to articulate and the coward knows not how to stand his ground. It's a society that will collapse in the end.
